## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome, but please make sure to read the [contributing guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) first.

## Translations

The preferred way to submit translations is through a Pull Request here on GitHub.

To enable translations in-game, go to Wurst Options > Translations > ON.

Names of features (hacks/commands/etc.) should always be kept in English. This ensures that everyone can use the same commands, keybinds, etc. regardless of their language setting. It also makes it easier to communicate with someone who uses Wurst in a different language.

The translation files are located in [this folder](https://github.com/Wurst-Imperium/Wurst7/tree/master/src/main/resources/assets/wurst/translations), in case you need them.

## For Alexander01998
Despite the fact that I have directly posted a copy of my work online, I am still banned by the creator of this client.
Well, then so be it. I inform you, dear Alexander, that the light did not come together in a wedge on the official build - there are still not enough QOL functions. 
And the meaning of your hehe "punishments" is reduced to zero.
